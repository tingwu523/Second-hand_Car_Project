Instruction:
At the very beginning, there are 6 files in our project in total, including:
- 3 python files: "project_code1.py", "project_code2.py", and "test_program.py"
- 2 CSV files with our initial data: "car_price_prediction.csv" and "USA_cars_datasets.csv"
- 1 README.md file for illustration of running the code

Firstly, please run the "project_code1.py" file, in which we combined the two datasets and did the basic and general cleaning for our data. After running it, there will be a new csv file called "combined_data.csv" which will be used in our next step.

Secondly, please run the "project_code2.py" file, in which we did the deeper analysis of our data and did the machine learning. After clicking the run button, 6 figures/plots will pop up to show to you one by one on the screen, they can be closed and saved automatically in the folder after you close them one by one. The 6th plot "boxplots_cat_feature.png" might take longer time to process than others since it contains twelve subplots. In addition, there will be a new csv file called "test_data", which will be used to run the test_program that we will introduce later. Moreover, it also print out some useful data information in the terminal for our analyzing and reports.

Thirdly, please run the "test_program.py", which we created for testing our code and function written in the main python file. You will see "Pass! ..." if the code behaves well and correctly under our expectations. 

Congratulations! After running those three python files, you will have 14 files in total in this folder, including 3 python files, 6 png plots, 4 csv data files, and 1 me - README.md!
